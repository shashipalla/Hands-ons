    <img src="./1.jpg" alt="rrr poster" width="500">
    <p>RRR[a] is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It centers around fictional versions of two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their friendship, and their fight against the British Raj.

        Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.
        
        Made on a budget of ‚Çπ550 crore (US$72 million), RRR is the most expensive Indian film to date. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed multiple times due to production delays and the COVID pandemic. RRR was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With ‚Çπ240 crore (US$30 million) worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ‚Çπ415 crore (US$52 million).[6] The film grossed ‚Çπ1,200 crore (US$150 million) ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,258 crore (US$160 million) worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film and second highest-grossing Telugu film worldwide.[4][7]
        
        RRR received universal praise for Rajamouli's direction, performances, soundtrack, action sequences, and visuals. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the list.[8] The song "Naatu Naatu" won the Best Original Song award at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category.[9][10] The film became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for "Naatu Naatu", making it the first Indian (as well as the first Asian) nomination to win the award.[11][12] RRR also won the Best Foreign Language Film and the Best Song award at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards.</p>

    <!-- <h3>The Good:</h3> -->
    <h4>The Duo: N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan</h4>
    <p>This is the first time in the history of South Indian cinema that two of the biggest action superstars came together for an epic historic action drama. N. T. Rama Rao Jr., who is the grandson of the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. T. Rama Rao, needs no introduction! If you have watched his past films you will get to know what level of action this actor is capable of. Reports reveal that Rama Rao had to go through an 18-month rigorous training program to step into the character of Bheem, who has been portrayed as an immense physical specimen in RRR.

        Ram Charan, the son of the legendary actor Chiranjeevi, is another explosive action hero in the South Indian film industry. He sports a tremendous muscular physique and his physique has amplified the character of Alluri Sitarama Raju. If you have watched his hit-action thriller ‚ÄúYevadu‚Äù, you would agree that he is one of those superstars whom even the Bollywood industry would crave for!</p>
